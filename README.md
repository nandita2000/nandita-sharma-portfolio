- [Inventory Management and Vendor Analysis](https://github.com/nandita2000/Power-Bi-Dashboards/blob/4b1371de20d0f742bb54998a1e7c2055198281d9/inventory_analysis_report.pbix)
  
-  The Inventory and Vendor Analysis Report is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to provide insights into inventory management and vendor performance. The report encompasses multiple pages, each focusing on different aspects of inventory and vendor analysis to optimize procurement, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.
 Key features include ABC Analysis for inventory and vendors, providing insights into the critical items and suppliers that contribute most significantly to the business.
ABC Analysis classifies inventory items into three categories based on their value and importance to the business: A (high-value items), B (medium-value items), and C (low-value items).

The A items — typically the most expensive and most important — should be managed with extra care and attention. The B items are also important for the business’s success, but not as much as A. The C items are not as important for the business’s success.

###Key Pages and Features

### Inventory Analysis
- **ABC Analysis**: Perform ABC Analysis on inventory items to categorize them based on their value and prioritize management efforts.
- **Other Inventory Metrics**: Analyze other inventory metrics such as turnover ratio, stockouts, and carrying costs to optimize inventory levels and reduce holding costs.
- **Inventory Trends**: Visualize inventory trends over time to identify seasonality, demand patterns, and potential stockpile or depletion risks.
